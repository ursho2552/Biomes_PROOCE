## Biome partitioning of the global ocean based on phytoplankton biogeography

This repository is a set of matlab functions used to partition the global open ocean based on the presence patterns of phytoplankton species.
To this end, we train self-organizing maps and use a PCA-hierarchical agglomerative clustering approach.

The manuscript detailing the resulting biomes has been published in [Progress in Oceanography](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pocean.2021.102530), and can be cited as:
